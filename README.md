##Boris Bikes - Object Oriented Programming

The goal of this task was to introduce us to Object Oriented Programming. The aim was to build a system based on the London Boris Bikes Initiative.

Users can collect and dock bikes. When a bike breaks, it would be sent through a repairing process. In this repairing process the bike would be transported to a garage by a van, which would then be repaired. Once repaired it would be collected from said garage and dropped off at a docking station.  

The concept on fixed capacity was also added into this project. Hence the van, all stations, and the garage cannot take more bikes that they can hold.
